root@box:~$ cat short-intro.txt
- average 18yo computer enjoyer from finland, been tinkering with and taking computers apart since i was 11.

root@box:~$ cat interests.txt
- cybersecurity / hacking / ctf competitions (~5 years of experience),
by no means am i somekind of super elite 1337 hax0r, i simply do it out of curiosity as i've always wanted to know why and how things work the way they do.
my strenghts are in web-development & sys-administration, my overall programming skills are intermediate and i'm somewhat competent in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP & Python.
i've also played around with memory exploitation / hijacking with C#/C++ due to my interest in game hacking (which i'm not great at).
